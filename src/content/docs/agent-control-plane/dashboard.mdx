## About This Dashboard

This dashboard displays real-time status information for all sprites in the fleet. Data is refreshed automatically every 60 seconds.

### Status Indicators

- **Unhealthy** (red): Sprite is cold, not found, or has errors

### API Status

|--------|---------|
| `warm` | Sprite is running and ready |
| `running` | Sprite is actively executing |
| `cold` | Sprite is suspended, needs wake |
| `not_found` | Sprite doesn't exist |
| `error` | API returned an error |

### Tools

- **codex**: OpenAI Codex CLI

### Data Source

Fleet status is generated by the Fleet Manager running on N100 hardware. The JSON file is updated every 5 minutes via cron job:

```bash
# On N100 server

```
