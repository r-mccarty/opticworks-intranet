## Coder + N100 Troubleshooting

The Coder workspace docs include troubleshooting steps for:

- SSH access to N100
- Coder CLI authentication
- Template pushes

See `agent-harness/docs/n100-coder-access.md` for commands and expected outputs.

## N8N Support

The N8N deployment is documented in `n8n-marketing-automation/SETUP.md` with operational commands such as:

```bash
ssh n100
cd /opt/n8n
docker compose logs -f
```

## Unlisted Support Processes

No formal ticketing or escalation process is documented in the repos audited so far. Provide the official policy if this should be expanded.
