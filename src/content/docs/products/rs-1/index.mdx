## What is the RS-1?

The RS-1 is a sensor fusion device that combines:

- **24GHz mmWave Radar** - Detects presence through movement and micro-movements (breathing, heartbeat)
- **3MP Vision Sensor** - Provides precise location tracking and occupancy counting
- **Edge AI Processing** - All processing happens locally for privacy and low latency

### Key Features

| Feature | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| Detection Range | Up to 6 meters |
| Field of View | 120° horizontal, 90° vertical |
| Tracking Targets | Up to 3 simultaneous |
| Update Rate | 30Hz real-time |
| Latency | < 100ms end-to-end |
| Privacy | 100% local processing, no cloud |

### What Makes RS-1 Different?

Unlike traditional PIR sensors that only detect motion, the RS-1 can:

- ✅ Detect stationary presence (someone sitting still, sleeping)
- ✅ Work in complete darkness
- ✅ Track precise location within a room
- ✅ Count multiple occupants
- ✅ Distinguish between humans and pets
- ✅ Integrate with any smart home platform
