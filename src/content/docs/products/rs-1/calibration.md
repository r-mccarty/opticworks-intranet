## RoomPlan Calibration (Verified)

RS-1 calibration is handled via Apple's RoomPlan data uploaded to `/api/setup/roomplan`. The API and payload format are documented in `hardwareOS/docs/rs1/ROOMPLAN_API.md`.

## Integration Testing

`hardwareOS/docs/rs1/ROOMPLAN_INTEGRATION_TESTING.md` describes how to capture RoomPlan data using third-party apps or Apple's sample code when a custom iOS app is not available.
